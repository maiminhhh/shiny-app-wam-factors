# 📊 Exploratory Analysis of WAM in DATA2X02

This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of student performance data in the University of Sydney's DATA2X02 course. The goal is to identify potential factors associated with **Weighted Average Mark (WAM)** through descriptive statistics and interactive visualization — *without building predictive models*.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📈 **Exploratory Analysis**:
  - Investigated patterns in quiz scores, tutorial participation, and assignment results.
  - Visualized distributions, trends, and outliers using summary statistics, boxplots, and scatterplots.
  - Highlighted relationships between course engagement and final WAM.

- 💻 **Interactive Shiny App**:
  - Built with `shiny` and hosted on **Posit Cloud**
  - Enables real-time filtering, comparison, and exploration of features linked to WAM  
  - 🔗 [Launch the App](https://maiminhhh.shinyapps.io/DATA2902_ShinyApp/)

- 📄 **Reproducible Reporting**:
  - Authored with **Quarto** for full transparency and reproducibility.
  - Includes both source (`.qmd`) and rendered HTML report.
