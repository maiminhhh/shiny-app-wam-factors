# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Analysis of WAM in DATA2X02

## Summary

This project presents an exploratory analysis of student data to understand **potential factors associated with Weighted Average Mark (WAM)** in the DATA2X02 course. The aim is to uncover **patterns and relationships** in the data through visualizations and descriptive statistics, without building predictive or statistical models.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Investigated relationships between variables such as quiz scores, tutorial engagement, and assignment performance.
  - Created summary statistics, boxplots, and scatterplots to explore how various features may relate to WAM.
  - Highlighted noteworthy trends and anomalies in the data.

- **Interactive Shiny App**:
  - Built a **Shiny web application** that enables users to:
    - Filter and explore the dataset interactively.
    - Visualize distributions and pairwise relationships.
    - Gain insights without needing to write R code.
  - ðŸ”— [View the app on Posit Cloud](https://maiminhhh.shinyapps.io/DATA2902_ShinyApp/) 

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: R (tidyverse, ggplot2, readr)
- **App**: Shiny + Posit Cloud
- **Report**: Quarto + HTML
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## Deliverables

- `[DATA2902] Final report.qmd` â†’ Rendered to HTML as the final written report.
- `[DATA2902] Individual_asm.R` â†’ Interactive application source code.
- Visualizations, variable summaries, and discussion of findings.
